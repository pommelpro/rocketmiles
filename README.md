# rocketmiles
This is the coding challenge for Rocketmiles. It gets the user's current location and display's the 5 day forecast.

In order to run this application, simply download the code and open `index.html` in Google Chrome. From there, you will be asked by the browser to share your location. If you do, then your location's weather will be populated with today's weather showing on the top left and the forecast to show up at the bottom.

If you do not provide your location, it will default to the Rocketmiles zip code of 60661 and show that forecast.
